Welcome to the Jadi's LPIC exam guide. I've tried to write a short, easy to understand but still comprehensive exam guide using *normal, easy to understand, English*. Remember that the exam is in English so you need to study in English!

This book is based on [LPI Exam 101](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-1/exam-101) titles.

Enjoy.
