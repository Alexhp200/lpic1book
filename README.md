# LPIC 101 exam for non-english human beings 

This book originally comes as part of a [free video tutorials for LPIC1 exam 101 by Jadi (Persian)](git@github.com:jadijadi/lpic1book.git) but it can also be used by its own for LPIC1-101 exam.

Latest version is always will be hosted at **http://j.mp/jadilpic1**

Welcome to the Jadi's LPIC exam guide. I've tried to write a short, easy to understand but still comprehensive exam guide using *normal, easy to understand, English*. Remember that the exam is in English so you need to study in English!

This book is based on [LPI Exam 101](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-1/exam-101) titles.

Enjoy.
