# LPIC 101 exam for non-english speakers


Laters version is always will be hosted at **http://j.mp/jadilpic1**

Welcome to the Jadi's LPIC exam guide. I've tried to write a short, easy to understand but still comprehensive exam guide using *normal, easy to understand, english*. Remember that the exam is in english so you need to study in english!

This book is based on [LPI Exam 101](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-1/exam-101) titles.

Enjoy.
